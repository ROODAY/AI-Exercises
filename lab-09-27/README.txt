The scripts in this folder are snapshots of the process of transforming a simple AoS network implementation to a classifier-style object.
The order of the files is:
AoSNetV1.py => AoSNetV1a.py => AoSNetV1b.py => AoSNetV2.py

AoSNetV2.py shows the general structure of a network object, but it is NOT the skeleton code of your first programming assignment.
The skeleton code is on the P1(NN) page of our course website.
